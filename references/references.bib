	abstract = {Tämän väitöskirjatyön tavoitteena oli tarkastella invarianttien koordinaattien valintaa ja tuoda uusia näkökulmia riippumattomien komponenttien analyysiin.

Moniulotteisten tilastollisten menetelmien yhteydessä kysymykset invarianttisuudesta ja ekvivarianttisuudesta nousevat usein esille. Toisinaan tilastollisia menetelmiä joudutaan muokkaamaan, jotta niille voidaan löytää invariantti tai ekvivariantti vastine. Tämä voidaan tehdä esimerkiksi transformoimalla data invarianttiin koordinaattisysteemiin.

Kahdessa väitöskirja-artikkelissa käsitellään invarianttien koordinaattien valintaa (ICS) ja ICS funktionaaleja. Moniulotteisen aineiston standardointia, ja ICS funktionaalien ja otossuureiden (asymptoottisia) ominaisuuksia tarkastellaan kattavasti. Myös moniulotteista huipukkuutta ja vinoutta käsitellään. ICS transformaatioiden sovellusalueista keskustellaan. Yksi tärkeä sovellusalue on riippumattomien komponenttien analyysi.

Riippumattomien komponenttien analyysi (ICA) on hyvin ajankohtainen tutkimusalue ja sillä on useita käytännön sovelluskohteita. Riippumattomien komponenttien mallissa p-ulotteisen satunnaisvektorin alkioiden oletetaan olevan sellaisen tuntemattoman p-ulotteisen satunnaisvektorin alkioiden lineaarikombinaatioita, jonka alkiot ovat toisistaan riippumattomia. Riippumattomien komponenttien analyysissä tavoitteena on löytää riippumattomat komponentit estimoimalla matriisia, joka välittää edellä kuvatun lineaaritransformaation. Uusia näkökulmia riippumattomien komponenttien analyysiin esitetään kolmessa väitöskirjan artikkelissa.

Yhdessä väitöskirja-artikkelissa esitetään uusi versio suositusta Deflation-based FastICA estimaattorista/algoritmista, jossa riippumattomat komponentit etsitään yksi kerrallaan. Tässä uudessa versiossa riippumattomat komponentit löydetään optimaalisessa järjestyksessä. Yhdessä artikkelissa esitetään (Le Cam mielessä) optimaalisia testaus - ja estimointimenetelmiä, kun riippumattomien komponenttien oletetaan tulevan symmetrisistä jakaumista. Yhdessä artikkelissa esitetään uusi menetelmä, jolla voidaan verrata erilaisia ICA estimaattoreita keskenään. Kaikissa kolmessa artikkelissa esitetään asymptoottisia tuloksia.

Väitöskirjan viimeisessä luvussa uusia menetelmiä sovelletaan käytännön aineistoon.},

	abstract = {Billions of users interact intensively every day via Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google+. This makes OSNs an invaluable source of information, and channel of actuation, for sectors like advertising, marketing, or politics. To get the most of OSNs, analysts need to identify influential users that can be leveraged for promoting products, distributing messages, or improving the image of companies. In this report we propose a new unsupervised method, Massive Unsupervised Outlier Detection (MUOD), based on outliers detection, for providing support in the identification of influential users. MUOD is scalable, and can hence be used in large OSNs. Moreover, it labels the outliers as of shape, magnitude, or amplitude, depending of their features. This allows classifying the outlier users in multiple different classes, which are likely to include different types of influential users. Applying MUOD to a subset of roughly 400 million Google+ users, it has allowed identifying and discriminating automatically sets of outlier users, which present features associated to different definitions of influential users, like capacity to attract engagement, capacity to attract a large number of followers, or high infection capacity.},

Based on the center outward ordering induced by band depth for functional data, the descriptive statistics of a functional boxplot are: the envelope of the 50\% central region, the median curve, and the maximum non-outlying envelope. In addition, outliers can be detected in a functional boxplot by the 1.5 times the 50\% central region empirical rule, analogous to the rule for classical boxplots. The construction of a functional boxplot is illustrated on a series of sea surface temperatures related to the El Niño phenomenon and its outlier detection performance is explored by simulations. As applications, the functional boxplot and enhanced functional boxplot are demonstrated on children growth data and spatio-temporal U.S. precipitation data for nine climatic regions, respectively.

	abstract = {The statistical analysis of functional data is a growing need in many research areas. In particular, a robust methodology is important to study curves, which are the output of many experiments in applied statistics. As a starting point for this robust analysis, we propose, analyze, and apply a new definition of depth for functional observations based on the graphic representation of the curves. Given a collection of functions, it establishes the “centrality” of an observation and provides a natural center-outward ordering of the sample curves. Robust statistics, such as the median function or a trimmed mean function, can be defined from this depth definition. Its finite-dimensional version provides a new depth for multivariate data that is computationally feasible and useful for studying high-dimensional observations. Thus, this new depth is also suitable for complex observations such as microarray data, images, and those arising in some recent marketing and financial studies. Natural properties of these new concepts are established and the uniform consistency of the sample depth is proved. Simulation results show that the corresponding depth based trimmed mean presents better performance than other possible location estimators proposed in the literature for some contaminated models. Data depth can be also used to screen for outliers. The ability of the new notions of depth to detect “shape” outliers is presented. Several real datasets are considered to illustrate this new concept of depth, including applications to microarray observations, weather data, and growth curves. Finally, through this depth, we generalize to functions the Wilcoxon rank sum test. It allows testing whether two groups of curves come from the same population. This functional rank test when applied to children growth curves shows different growth patterns for boys and girls.},

PDFs are interpreted as functional compositions, which are objects carrying primarily relative information. In this context, the unit integral constraint allows to single out one of the possible representations of a class of equivalent measures. On these bases, a function-on-scalar regression model with distributional response is proposed, by relying on the theory of Bayes Hilbert spaces. The geometry of Bayes spaces allows capturing all the key inherent features of distributional data (e.g., scale invariance, relative scale). A B-spline basis expansion combined with a functional version of the centered log-ratio transformation is utilized for actual computations. For this purpose, a new key result is proved to characterize B-spline representations in Bayes spaces. The potential of the methodological developments is shown on simulated data and a real case study, dealing with metabolomics data. A bootstrap-based study is performed for the uncertainty quantification of the obtained estimates.},

Our method and theory are focused on the additive model, while the main ideas may be adapted to other structured models. For this, the notion of Bochner integration is introduced for Banach-space-valued maps as a generalization of Lebesgue integration. Several statistical properties of Bochner integrals, relevant for our method and theory and also of importance in their own right, are presented for the first time. Our theory is complete. The existence of our estimators and the convergence of a practical algorithm that evaluates the estimators are established. These results are nonasymptotic as well as asymptotic. Furthermore, it is proved that the estimators achieve the univariate rates in pointwise, \$L{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ and uniform convergence, and that the estimators of the component maps converge jointly in distribution to Gaussian random elements. Our numerical examples include the cases of functional, density-valued and simplex-valued responses, demonstrating the validity of our approach.},

	abstract = {We propose and investigate additive density regression, a novel additive functional regression model for situations where the responses are random distributions that can be viewed as random densities and the predictors are vectors. Data in the form of samples of densities or distributions are increasingly encountered in statistical analysis and there is a need for flexible regression models that accommodate random densities as responses. Such models are of special interest for multivariate continuous predictors, where unrestricted nonparametric regression approaches are subject to the curse of dimensionality. Additive models can be expected to maintain one-dimensional rates of convergence while permitting a substantial degree of flexibility. This motivates the development of additive regression models for situations where multivariate continuous predictors are coupled with densities as responses. To overcome the problem that distributions do not form a vector space, we utilize a class of transformations that map densities to unrestricted square integrable functions and then deploy an additive functional regression model to fit the responses in the unrestricted space, finally transforming back to density space. We implement the proposed additive model with an extended version of smooth backfitting and establish the consistency of this approach, including rates of convergence. The proposed method is illustrated with an application to the distributions of baby names in the United States.},

	abstract = {With modern technology development, functional data are being observed frequently in many scientific fields. A popular method for analyzing such functional data is “smoothing first, then estimation.” That is, statistical inference such as estimation and hypothesis testing about functional data is conducted based on the substitution of the underlying individual functions by their reconstructions obtained by one smoothing technique or another. However, little is known about this substitution effect on functional data analysis. In this paper this problem is investigated when the local polynomial kernel (LPK) smoothing technique is used for individual function reconstructions. We find that under some mild conditions, the substitution effect can be ignored asymptotically. Based on this, we construct LPK reconstruction-based estimators for the mean, covariance and noise variance functions of a functional data set and derive their asymptotics. We also propose a GCV rule for selecting good bandwidths for the LPK reconstructions. When the mean function also depends on some time-independent covariates, we consider a functional linear model where the mean function is linearly related to the covariates but the covariate effects are functions of time. The LPK reconstruction-based estimators for the covariate effects and the covariance function are also constructed and their asymptotics are derived. Moreover, we propose a L2-norm-based global test statistic for a general hypothesis testing problem about the covariate effects and derive its asymptotic random expression. The effect of the bandwidths selected by the proposed GCV rule on the accuracy of the LPK reconstructions and the mean function estimator is investigated via a simulation study. The proposed methodologies are illustrated via an application to a real functional data set collected in climatology.},

	abstract = {Testing the equality of covariance functions is crucial for solving functional ANOVA problems. Available methods, such as the recently proposed L2-norm based tests work well when functional data are less correlated but are less powerful when functional data are highly correlated or with some local spikes, which are often the cases in real functional data analysis. To overcome this difficulty, a new test for the equality of several covariance functions is proposed. Its test statistic is taken as the supremum value of the sum of the squared differences between the estimated individual covariance functions and the pooled sample covariance function. The asymptotic random expressions of the test statistic under the null hypothesis and under a local alternative are derived and a non-parametric bootstrap method is suggested. The root-n consistency of the proposed test is also obtained. Intensive simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the finite sample performance of the proposed test. The simulation results show that the proposed test is indeed more powerful than several existing L2-norm based competitors when functional data are highly correlated or with some local spikes. The proposed test is illustrated with three real data examples collected in a wide scope of scientific fields.},

	abstract = {We propose two new outlier detection methods, for identifying and classifying different types of outliers in (big) functional data sets. The proposed methods are based on an existing method called Massive Unsupervised Outlier Detection (MUOD). MUOD detects and classifies outliers by computing for each curve, three indices, all based on the concept of linear regression and correlation, which measure outlyingness in terms of shape, magnitude and amplitude, relative to the other curves in the data. ‘Semifast-MUOD’, the first method, uses a sample of the observations in computing the indices, while ‘Fast-MUOD’, the second method, uses the point-wise or \$\$L\_1\$\$median in computing the indices. The classical boxplot is used to separate the indices of the outliers from those of the typical observations. Performance evaluation of the proposed methods using simulated data show significant improvements compared to MUOD, both in outlier detection and computational time. We show that Fast-MUOD is especially well suited to handling big and dense functional datasets with very small computational time compared to other methods. Further comparisons with some recent outlier detection methods for functional data also show superior or comparable outlier detection accuracy of the proposed methods. We apply the proposed methods on weather, population growth, and video data.},

Some methods adapting FastMUOD to outlier detection in multivariate functional data are then proposed. These include applying FastMUOD on the components of the multivariate data and using random projections. Moreover, these techniques are tested on various simulated and real multivariate functional datasets. Compared with the state of the art in multivariate functional OD, the use of random projections showed the most effective results with similar, and in some cases improved, OD performance. Based on the proportion of random projections that flag each multivariate function as an outlier, we propose a new graphical tool, the magnitude-shape-amplitude (MSA) plot, useful for visualizing the magnitude, shape and amplitude outlyingness of multivariate functional data.},

	abstract = {With the advance of technology, functional data are being recorded more frequently, whether over one-dimensional or multi-dimensional domains. Due to the high dimensionality and complex features of functional data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) faces significant challenges. To meet the demands of practical applications, researchers have developed various EDA tools, including visualization tools, outlier detection techniques, and clustering methods that can handle diverse types of functional data. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of recent procedures for exploratory functional data analysis (EFDA). It begins by introducing fundamental statistical concepts, such as mean and covariance functions, as well as robust statistics such as the median and quantiles in multivariate functional data. Then, the paper reviews popular visualization methods for functional data, such as the rainbow plot, and various versions of the functional boxplot, each designed to accommodate different features of functional data. In addition to visualization tools, the paper also reviews outlier detection methods, which are commonly integrated with visualization methods to identify anomalous patterns within the data. Finally, the paper focuses on functional data clustering techniques which provide another set of practical tools for EFDA. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions for EFDA. All the reviewed methods have been implemented in an R package named EFDA.},

Based on this manifold, we developed a conceptualization of functional outlier detection that is more widely applicable and realistic than previously proposed taxonomies. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrated several important advantages of this perspective: it considerably improves theoretical understanding and allows describing and analyzing complex functional outlier scenarios consistently and in full generality, by differentiating between structurally anomalous outlier data that are off-manifold and distributionally outlying data that are on-manifold, but at its margins. This improves the practical feasibility of functional outlier detection: we show that simple manifold-learning methods can be used to reliably infer and visualize the geometric structure of functional datasets. We also show that standard outlier-detection methods requiring tabular data inputs can be applied to functional data very successfully by simply using their vector-valued representations learned from manifold learning methods as the input features. Our experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrated that this approach leads to outlier detection performances at least on par with existing functional-data-specific methods in a large variety of settings, without the highly specialized, complex methodology and narrow domain of application these methods often entail.},

	abstract = {In functional data analysis, some regions of the domain of the functions can be of more interest than others owing to the quality of measurement, relative scale of the domain, or simply some external reason (e.g. interest of stakeholders). Weighting the domain is of interest particularly with probability density functions (PDFs), as derived from distributional data, which often aggregate measurements of different quality or are affected by scale effects. A weighting scheme can be embedded into the underlying sample space of a PDF when it is considered as continuous compositions applying the theory of Bayes spaces. The origin of a Bayes space is determined by a given reference measure, and this can be easily changed through the well‐known chain rule. This work provides a formal framework for defining weights through a reference measure, and it is used to develop a weighting scheme on the bounded domain of distributional data. The impact on statistical analysis is illustrated through an application to functional principal component analysis of income distribution data. Moreover, a novel centred log‐ratio transformation is proposed to map a weighted Bayes space into an unweighted 
 space, enabling to use most tools developed in functional data analysis (e.g. clustering and regression analysis) while accounting for the weighting scheme. The potential of our proposal is shown on a real case study using Italian income data.},

	abstract = {With the advance of modern technology, more and more data are being recorded continuously during a time interval or intermittently at several discrete time points. These are both examples of functional data, which has become a commonly encountered type of data. Functional data analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is functional principal component analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool, and in sparse data situations it can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single- or multiple- index methods, we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models and models that feature time warping, manifold learning, and empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

Identifying magnitude outliers is relatively easy, while detecting shape outliers is much more challenging. We propose turning the shape outliers into magnitude outliers through data transformation and detecting them using the functional boxplot. Besides easing the detection procedure, applying several transformations sequentially provides a reasonable taxonomy for the flagged outliers. A joint functional ranking, which consists of several transformations, is also defined here. Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method using different functional depth notions. Interesting results are obtained in several practical applications.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the temporal occurrence of dry conditions in the seven climatic sub-regions of Vietnam during the 1980–2017 period. This assessment was performed using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at 1 to 24 months timescales. Results show that the main periods of extreme drought occurred simultaneously throughout the country in 1992–1993 and 2003–2004, except for 2015–2016, when it was not identified in the southern region. In addition, a slight temporal lag was identified latitudinally (north–south) at the beginning of dry conditions, revealing the largest difference between the northern and southern regions. A positive trend in the time series of both indices (SPEI and SPI) prevailed in all sub-regions, with the SPEI minus SPI difference always being negative, suggesting the importance of temperature and evapotranspiration for this trend. Further detailed analyses were then performed using SPEI at 1-month and 12-months timescales for all climate sub-regions, as well as the main indicators to characterize duration and severity. Results show that the number of drought episodes did not vary much between regions, but they did vary in duration and severity at the annual scale. Moreover, changes in the soil root zone are largely associated with dry and wet conditions not only from season to season, but also in longer accumulation periods and more strongly in the northern regions of Vietnam. Indeed, a study of the most severe drought episodes also revealed the occurrence of negative anomalies of the root-soil moisture in the subsequent four or more months. Dynamic atmospheric conditions associated with the peak of most severe drought episodes show the crucial role of subsidence of dry air in the middle and high atmosphere, which prevents convection in the lower troposphere. Finally, the linkages between drought conditions in Vietnam and large-scale atmospheric and oceanic teleconnection patterns were revealed to be quite different among northern and southern sub-regions. During the positive phase of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), drought episodes at different timescales were identified in the southern climate sub-regions, while the negative phase was associated with drought conditions in the northern regions.},

The limiting case of the estimates as the amount of smoothing increases has a natural form which makes the method attractive for data analysis and which provides a rationale for a particular choice of roughness penalty. The estimates are shown to be the solution of an unconstrained convex optimization problem, and mild natural conditions are given for them to exist. Rates of consistency in various norms and conditions for asymptotic normality and approximation by a Gaussian process are given, thus breaking new ground in the theory of maximum penalized likelihood density estimation.},

Outlier detection and robustness are of great practical interest; however, these aspects remain unexplored for distributional data. To this end, this study focuses on density-valued outlier detection and its application in robust distributional regression. Specifically, we propose a transformation-based approach for single-dataset outlying density detection with an emphasis on converting the less detectable shape outliers to easily detectable magnitude outliers. We also propose a distributional regression-based approach for detecting the abnormal associations of the density-valued two-tuples associated with two datasets. Then, the proposed outlier detection methods are applied to robustify a distribution-to-distribution regression method used in engineering, and we develop a robust estimator for the regression operator by downweighting the detected outliers. The proposed methods are validated and evaluated via extensive simulation studies. The relevant results reveal the superiority of our method over other competitors in distributional outlier detection. A case study in structural health monitoring demonstrates the great potential of our proposal in engineering applications. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

It is even more difficult to realize that so many statisticians and users of statistics are unaware of the particular problems affecting compositional data, as well as their solutions. The issue of ``spurious correlation, as the situation was phrased by Karl Pearson back in 1897, affects all data that measures parts of some whole, such as percentages, proportions, ppm and ppb. Such measurements are present in all fields of science, ranging from geology, biology, environmental sciences, forensic sciences, medicine and hydrology. This book presents the history and development of compositional data analysis along with Aitchisons log-ratio approach. Compositional Data Analysis describes the state of the art both in theoretical fields as well as applications in the different fields of science. Key Features: Reflects the state-of-the-art in compositional data analysis. Gives an overview of the historical development of compositional data analysis, as well as basic concepts and procedures. Looks at advances in algebra and calculus on the simplex. Presents applications in different fields of science, including, genomics, ecology, biology, geochemistry, planetology, chemistry and economics. Explores connections to correspondence analysis and the Dirichlet distribution. Presents a summary of three available software packages for compositional data analysis. Supported by an accompanying website featuring R code. Applied scientists working on compositional data analysis in any field of science, both in academia and professionals will benefit from this book, along with graduate students in any field of science working with compositional data.},

In recent years many research papers have proposed generalizations of multivariatetechniques to the functional data case. In this paper we introduce an extension of themultivariate kurtosis for functional data, and we analyze some of its properties. Inparticular, we explore if our proposal preserves some of the properties of the kurtosisprocedures applied to the multivariate case, regarding the identification of outliers andcluster structures.

@phdthesis{rendon_aguirre_clustering_2017,
	title = {Clustering in high dimension for multivariate and functional data using extreme kurtosis projections},
	abstract = {Cluster analysis is a problem that consists of the analysis of the existence of clusters in a multivariate sample. This analysis is performed by algorithms that differ significantly in their notion of what constitutes a cluster and how to find them efficiently. In this thesis we are interested in large data problems and therefore we consider algorithms that use dimension reduction techniques for the identification of interesting structures in large data sets. Particularly in those algorithms that use the kurtosis coefficient to detect the clusters present in the data. The thesis extends the work of Peña and Prieto (2001a) of identifying clusters in multivariate data using the univariate projections of the sample data on the directions that minimize and maximize the kurtosis coefficient of the projected data, and Peña et al. (2010) who used the eigenvalues of a kurtosis matrix to reduce the dimension. This thesis has two main contributions: First, we prove that the extreme kurtosis projections have some optimality properties for mixtures of normal distributions and we propose an algorithm to identify clusters when the data dimension and the number of clusters present in the sample are high. The good performance of the algorithm is shown through a simulations study where it is compared it with MCLUST, K-means and CLARA methods. Second, we propose the extension of multivariate kurtosis for functional data, and we analyze some of its properties for clustering. Additionally, we propose an algorithm based on kurtosis projections for functional data. Its good properties are compared with the results obtained by Functional Principal Components, Functional K-means and FunClust method. The thesis is structured as follows: Chapter 1 is an introductory Chapter where we will review some theoretical concepts that will be used throughout the thesis. In Chapter 2 we review in detail the concept of kurtosis. We study the properties of kurtosis. Give a detailed description of some algorithms proposed in the literature that use the kurtosis coefficient to detect the clusters present in the data. In Chapter 3 we study the directions that may be interesting for the detection of several clusters in the sample and we analyze how the extreme kurtosis directions are related to these directions. In addition, we present a clustering algorithm for high-dimensional data using extreme kurtosis directions. In Chapter 4 we introduce an extension of the multivariate kurtosis for the functional data and we analyze the properties of this measure regarding the identification of clusters.

	doi = {10.1016/j.ecosta.2024.03.002},
	abstract = {For multivariate data, tandem clustering is a well-known technique aiming to improve cluster identification through initial dimension reduction. Nevertheless, the usual approach using principal component analysis (PCA) has been criticized for focusing solely on inertia so that the first components do not necessarily retain the structure of interest for clustering. To address this limitation, a new tandem clustering approach based on invariant coordinate selection (ICS) is proposed. By jointly diagonalizing two scatter matrices, ICS is designed to find structure in the data while providing affine invariant components. Certain theoretical results have been previously derived and guarantee that under some elliptical mixture models, the group structure can be highlighted on a subset of the first and/or last components. However, ICS has garnered minimal attention within the context of clustering. Two challenges associated with ICS include choosing the pair of scatter matrices and selecting the components to retain. For effective clustering purposes, it is demonstrated that the best scatter pairs consist of one scatter matrix capturing the within-cluster structure and another capturing the global structure. For the former, local shape or pairwise scatters are of great interest, as is the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator based on a carefully chosen subset size that is smaller than usual. The performance of ICS as a dimension reduction method is evaluated in terms of preserving the cluster structure in the data. In an extensive simulation study and empirical applications with benchmark data sets, various combinations of scatter matrices as well as component selection criteria are compared in situations with and without outliers. Overall, the new approach of tandem clustering with ICS shows promising results and clearly outperforms the PCA-based approach.},

This surge in interest is motivated by the ubiquitous nature of functional data, which are prevalent in applications across fields such as meteorology, biology, medicine and engineering. Empirical probability density functions (PDFs) can be viewed as constrained functional data objects that must integrate to one and be nonnegative. They show up in contexts such as yearly income distributions, zooplankton size structure in oceanography and in connectivity patterns in the brain, among others. While PDF data are certainly common in modern research, little attention has been given to EDA specifically for PDFs. In this paper, we extend several methods for EDA on functional data for PDFs and compare them on simulated data that exhibit different types of variation, designed to mimic that seen in real-world applications. We then use our new methods to perform EDA on the breakthrough curves observed in gas transport simulations for underground fracture networks.},

This study focuses on industrial applications where image data are used more and more for quality inspection and statistical process monitoring.

Examples are pores in parts obtained via casting or additive manufacturing, voids in metal foams and light-weight components, grains in metallographic analysis, etc. The proposed approach summarizes the random occurrences of the observed features via their (empirical) probability density functions (PDFs). In particular, a novel approach for PDF monitoring is proposed. It is based on simplicial functional principal component analysis (SFPCA), which is performed within the space of density functions, that is, the Bayes space B2. A simulation study shows the enhanced monitoring performances provided by SFPCA-based profile monitoring against other competitors proposed in the literature. Finally, a real case study dealing with the quality control of foamed material production is discussed, to highlight a practical use of the proposed methodology.

The data is then summarized for all reporting stations on a daily basis to current operational requirements related to the assessment of crop and energy production.Data coverage begins in 1979. In 1987 there is a format change and additional parameters were added. Major parameters include maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure, sea level pressure, maximum relative humidity, and minimum relative humidity. If the maximum or minimum temperatures are not reported, they are estimated from reported air temperatures in the regular synoptic reports when sufficient data exist. Starting in 1994, total sky cover, 3-hourly wind direction and speed, and total snow depth are included. There are approximately 8900 actively reporting stations. Periods of record vary widely among the stations. CAUTIONARY NOTE: NCEP incorrectly decoded the wind units indicator from February 1, 2001 until 1500 UTC on June 11, 2002, which caused a knots versus meters-per-second problem. Not all stations were affected. Users may, with caution, apply the knots or meters-per-second conversion where it appears to be the correct choice.},

So the setting is quite similar to that of the classical one-way anova model but the k samples under study consist of functional data. A simple natural test for this problem is proposed. It can be seen as an asymptotic version of the well-known anova F-test. The asymptotic validity of the method is shown. A numerical Monte Carlo procedure is proposed to handle in practice the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic. A simulation study is included and a real-data example in experimental cardiology is considered in some detail.},

Moreover, diﬃculties arise when dealing with distances between densities. The crucial point is that usual distances are not invariant under relevant transformations of densities. To overcome these limitations, Aitchison’s ideas on compositional data analysis are used, generalizing perturbation and power transformation, as well as the Aitchison inner product, to operations on probability density functions with support on a ﬁnite interval. With these operations at hand, it is shown that the set of bounded probability density functions on ﬁnite intervals is a pre-Hilbert space. A Hilbert space of densities, whose logarithm is square-integrable, is obtained as the natural completion of the pre-Hilbert space.},

The model is driven by the ERA-40 reanalysis data as initial and lateral boundary conditions, and is forced by the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) data over the oceans. Validations were carried out by comparing the simulated circulation fields, 2 m air temperatures, and precipitation to globally available observation data, and data from 50 meteorological stations over 7 sub-regions of Vietnam. In general, the simulated patterns of the interested fields are in good agreement with observed data. Although being somewhat wetter or dryer and cooler, RegCM3 reproduces relatively well the observed annual cycle and the inter-annual variability of surface air temperature and precipitation. A large proportion of the negative biases in temperature over Vietnam is explained by the lapse rate correction process. After correction for elevation differences, the model still underestimates air temperature over most of the sub-regions. In rainy and dry seasons, RegCM3 generally underestimates and overestimates precipitation, respectively.},

These crops comprise two of the four largest sources of caloric energy produced and are thus critical for world food supply. We pair a panel of county-level yields for these two crops, plus cotton (a warmer-weather crop), with a new fine-scale weather dataset that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the growing season. We find that yields increase with temperature up to 29° C for corn, 30° C for soybeans, and 32° C for cotton but that temperatures above these thresholds are very harmful. The slope of the decline above the optimum is significantly steeper than the incline below it. The same nonlinear and asymmetric relationship is found when we isolate either time-series or cross-sectional variations in temperatures and yields. This suggests limited historical adaptation of seed varieties or management practices to warmer temperatures because the cross-section includes farmers' adaptations to warmer climates and the time-series does not. Holding current growing regions fixed, area-weighted average yields are predicted to decrease by 30–46\% before the end of the century under the slowest (B1) warming scenario and decrease by 63–82\% under the most rapid warming scenario (A1FI) under the Hadley III model.},

Consequently, we view this method as a method for invariant co-ordinate selection. By plotting the data with respect to this new invariant co-ordinate system, various data structures can be revealed. For example, under certain independent components models, it is shown that the invariant coordinates correspond to the independent components. Another example pertains to mixtures of elliptical distributions.

Using this characterization, we establish a stochastic optimality property for the principal component subspaces associated with an elliptically distributed random element, which holds even when second moments do not exist. In addition, when second moments exist, we establish an optimality property regarding unitarily invariant norms of the residuals covariance operator.},

A Bahadur-type asymptotic linear representation and the associated weak convergence results for the sample spatial quantiles in infinite dimensional spaces are derived. A study of the asymptotic efficiency of the sample spatial median relative to the sample mean is carried out for some standard probability distributions in function spaces.

	abstract = {A Bayes linear space is a linear space of equivalence classes of proportional  -ﬁnite measures, including probability measures. Measures are identiﬁed with their density functions. Addition is given by Bayes’ rule and substraction by Radon–Nikodym derivatives. The present contribution shows the subspace of square-log-integrable densities to be a Hilbert space, which can include probability and inﬁnite measures, measures on the whole real line or discrete measures. It extends the ideas from the Hilbert space of densities on a ﬁnite support towards Hilbert spaces on general measure spaces. It is also a generalisation of the Euclidean structure of the simplex, the sample space of random compositions. In this framework, basic notions of mathematical statistics get a simple algebraic interpretation. A key tool is the centred-log-ratio transformation, a generalization of that used in compositional data analysis, which maps the Hilbert space of measures into a subspace of square-integrable functions. As a consequence of this structure, distances between densities, orthonormal bases, and Fourier series representing measures become available. As an application, Fourier series of normal distributions and distances between them are derived, and an example related to grain size distributions is presented. The geometry of the sample space of random compositions, known as Aitchison geometry of the simplex, is obtained as a particular case of the Hilbert space when the measures have discrete and ﬁnite support. Key words: Aitchison geometry of the simplex; distance between measures; Fourier coefﬁcients; inﬁnite measures; normal distribution; perturbation; probability measures.},

The observations are thus usually high dimensional, spatially dependent and of compositional nature. In this paper, a novel blind source separation approach for spatially dependent data is suggested. For the analysis, it is assumed that the multivariate observations are linear combinations or mixtures of latent components and that the spatial processes for these latent components are second order stationary and uncorrelated. In the present approach, the latent components are then recovered by simultaneously diagonalizing the covariance matrix and a local covariance (correlation) matrix. This method can be easily applied also in the context of compositional data after appropriate data transformations. The components obtained in this way are uncorrelated and easily interpretable, and can be used for dimension reduction and for visual presentation of different features of the data. To demonstrate the usefulness of the new method, the KOLA data are reanalyzed using the new procedure and the results are compared to the results coming from marginal principal component analysis and independent component analysis that ignore spatial dependence.},

Amongst our depth defining properties is one that addresses the delicate challenge of inherent partial observability of functional data, with fulfillment giving rise to a minimal guarantee on the performance of the empirical depth beyond the idealised and practically infeasible case of full observability. As an incidental product, functional depths satisfying our definition achieve a robustness that is commonly ascribed to depth, despite the absence of a formal guarantee in the multivariate definition of depth. We demonstrate the fulfillment or otherwise of our properties for six widely used functional depth proposals, thereby providing a systematic basis for selection of a depth function.},

              Episodes of severe weather in the United States, such as the present abundance of
rainfall in California, are brandished as tangible evidence of the future costs of
current climate trends. Hsiang
              et al.
              collected national data
documenting the responses in six economic sectors to short-term weather fluctuations.
These data were integrated with probabilistic distributions from a set of global climate
models and used to estimate future costs during the remainder of this century across a
range of scenarios (see the Perspective by Pizer). In terms of overall effects on gross
domestic product, the authors predict negative impacts in the southern United States and
positive impacts in some parts of the Pacific Northwest and New England.

            Estimates of climate change damage are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2\% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20\% of county income (90\% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).},

	abstract = {In high reliability standards fields such as automotive, avionics or aerospace, the detection of anomalies is crucial. An efficient methodology for automatically detecting multivariate outliers is introduced. It takes advantage of the remarkable properties of the Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS) method which leads to an affine invariant coordinate system in which the Euclidian distance corresponds to a Mahalanobis Distance (MD) in the original coordinates. The limitations of MD are highlighted using theoretical arguments in a context where the dimension of the data is large. Owing to the resulting dimension reduction, ICS is expected to improve the power of outlier detection rules such as MD-based criteria. The paper includes practical guidelines for using ICS in the context of a small proportion of outliers. The use of the regular covariance matrix and the so called matrix of fourth moments as the scatter pair is recommended. This choice combines the simplicity of implementation together with the possibility to derive theoretical results. The selection of relevant invariant components through parallel analysis and normality tests is addressed. A simulation study confirms the good properties of the proposal and provides a comparison with Principal Component Analysis and MD. The performance of the proposal is also evaluated on two real data sets using a user-friendly R package accompanying the paper.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12966-018-0685-1},
	abstract = {Background: Data on time spent in physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep during a day is compositional in nature, i.e. they add up to a constant value. Compositional data have fundamentally different properties from unconstrained data in real space, and require other analytical procedures, referred to as compositional data analysis (CoDA). Most physical activity and sedentary behavior studies, however, still apply analytical procedures adapted to data in real space, which can lead to misleading results. The present study describes a comparison of time spent sedentary and in physical activity between age groups and sexes, and investigates the extent to which results obtained by CoDA differ from those obtained using standard analytical procedures.
Methods: Time spent sedentary, standing, and in physical activity (walking/running/stair climbing/cycling) during work and leisure was determined for 1–4 days among 677 blue-collar workers using accelerometry. Differences between sexes and age groups were tested using MANOVA, using both a standard and a CoDA approach based on isometric log-ratio transformed data.
Results: When determining differences between sexes for different activities time at work, the effect size using standard analysis (η2 = 0.045, p {\textless} 0.001) was 15\% smaller than that obtained with CoDA (η2 = 0.052, p {\textless} 0.001), although both approaches suggested a statistically significant difference. When determining corresponding differences between age groups, CoDA resulted in a 60\% larger, and significant, effect size (η2 = 0.012, p = 0.02) than that obtained with the standard approach (η2 = 0.008, p = 0.07). During leisure, results based on standard (age; η2 = 0.007, p = 0.09; sex; η2 = 0.052, p {\textless} 0.001) and CoDA (age; η2 = 0.007, p = 0.09; sex; η2 = 0.051, p {\textless} 0.001) analyses were similar.
Conclusion: Results and, hence, inferences concerning age and sex-based differences in time spent sedentary and in physical activity at work differed between CoDA and standard analysis. We encourage researchers to use CoDA in similar studies, to adequately account for the compositional nature of data on physical activity and sedentary behavior.},

The results show that in the dry season, increases in temperatures are beneﬁcial to all farms in the warmer southern regions, while increases in precipitation will damage only irrigated farms in the Central and South regions. The impact of higher temperature in the wet season is similar, except that it will negatively affect net revenue of irrigated farms in the long run. More rainfall in the wet season will increase net revenue in the North region only. Finally, this study combines the estimated results with future climate scenarios to predict how future changes in climate will affect farmers on aggregate.},

A new class of nonparametric covariance function estimators in terms of various spectral regularizations of an operator associated with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is developed. Despite their nonparametric nature, the covariance estimators are automatically positive semi-definite, which is an essential property of covariance functions, via a one-step procedure. An unconventional representer theorem is established to provide a finite dimensional representation for this class of covariance estimators based on data, although the solutions are searched over infinite dimensional functional spaces. To further achieve a low-rank representation, another desirable property, e.g., for dimension reduction and easy interpretation, the trace-norm regularization is particularly studied, under which an efficient algorithm is developed based on the accelerated proximal gradient method. The outstanding practical performance of the trace-norm-regularized covariance estimator is demonstrated by a simulation study and the analysis of a traffic dataset. Under both fixed and random designs, an excellent rate of convergence is established for a broad class of operator-regularized covariance function estimators, which generalizes both the trace-norm-regularized covariance estimator and other popular alternatives.},

Under mild conditions, asymptotically our test has the correct level and is root-n consistent in detecting local alternatives. Simulation studies show that the proposed test outperforms several existing tests in terms of both size control and power when the correlation between observations at any two different points is high or moderate, and it is comparable with the competitors otherwise. Application to an ischemic heart dataset suggests that resting electrocardiogram signals may contain enough information for ischemic heart screening at outpatient clinics, without the help of stress tests required by the current standard procedure.},

Also, these proﬁles are proxies for functional diversity or functional traits of a microbial community, usually linked to the ecosystem functioning. However, statistical data analysis of CLPPs has turned out to be the main handicap in these studies. Speciﬁcally, the interference of inoculum density, the need to choose an optimal incubation time and the different proﬁles obtained depending on the incubation time-point limits its usefulness. To this aim, we have developed a new approach for CLPP data analysis that considers the whole data set and dynamics of colour development along the incubation period. This approach is based on compositional data (CoDa) transformation, which reﬂects relative rather than absolute information, followed by repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance and data representation in a canonical variates plot. The approach has been tested by using CLPPs from real ﬂuvial bioﬁlm samples aﬀected by seasonality, ﬂow stress and diﬀerent sediment depth conditions, and it has been compared to the most classic applied approaches until today (incubation ﬁxed point or curve integration, followed by a Principal Components Analysis). Our results highlight that the proposed approach (i) makes ecological interpretation of CLPPs more sensitive, (ii) clariﬁes diﬀerences between CLPPs even in situations of marked seasonality while classical approaches provided confounding results, (iii) produces ecologically meaningful results (i.e. the proposed approach showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in organic matter use capabilities among ﬂow conditions and depth), and (iv) uniﬁes the analysis methodology for CLPPs data.

The Bayes space methodology of density functions enables to express them as real functions in the standard L2 space using the centered log-ratio transformation.

This is a key to propose a new spline basis, holding the same property, and consequently to build a new class of spline functions, called compositional splines, which can approximate probability density functions in a consistent way. The paper provides also construction of smoothing compositional splines and possible orthonormalization of the spline basis which might be useful in some applications.

	abstract = {The chemical composition of sediments is controlled predominantly by the sediment grain size, and thus evaluating their relationship is an important task in sedimentary geochemistry. The grain size is characterized by the respective particle size distribution, which can be expressed as a probability density function. Because of the relative character of densities, the Bayes space methodology was employed to build a regression model between a real response and a density function as a covariate, here the chemical composition and the particle size density. For practical computations, density functions were expressed in the standard L2 space using the centred logratio transformation and spline approximation of the input discretized densities was utilized by respecting the induced zero-integral constraint. After a concise simulation study, supporting the relevance of the proposed regression model, the new methodology was applied to examine the relationship between sediment grain size and geochemical composition, with samples being obtained in the Czech Republic in the Skalka Reservoir and in the Ohrˇe River ﬂoodplain upstream of the reservoir, to reveal proper grain size proxies. The Al/Si and Zr/Rb logratios in the sediments that were studied showed grain-size control, which makes them suitable for this purpose.},

	abstract = {Multivariate functional anomaly detection has received a large amount of attention recently. Accounting both the time dimension and the correlations between variables is challenging due to the existence of different types of outliers and the dimension of the data. In the context of predictive maintenance and quality control, data sets often contain a large number of functional variables. However, most of the existing methods focus on a small number of functional variables. Moreover, in fields that have high reliability standards, detecting a small number of potential multivariate functional outliers with as few false positives as possible is crucial. In such a context, the adaptation of the Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS) method from the multivariate to the multivariate functional case is of particular interest. Two extensions of ICS are proposed: point-wise and global. For both methods, the choice of the relevant components together with outlier identification and interpretation are discussed. A comparison is made on a predictive maintenance example from the avionics field and a quality control example from the microelectronics field. It appears that in such a context, point-wise and global ICS with a small number of selected components can be recommended.},

These approaches must rely on a sliding window so that time-shift versions of a periodic subsequence can be measured to be similar. Coupled with the use of a root point-to-point measure, existing methods often have quadratic time complexity. We offer the third R domain approach. It begins with an insight that subsequences in a periodic time series can be treated as sets of independent and identically distributed (iid) points generated from an unknown distribution in R. This R domain treatment enables two new possibilities: (a) the similarity between two subsequences can be computed using a distributional measure such as Wasserstein distance (WD), kernel mean embedding or Isolation Distributional kernel (IDK); and (b) these distributional measures become non-sliding-window-based. Together, they offer an alternative that has more effective similarity measurements and runs significantly faster than the point-to-point and sliding-window-based measures. Our empirical evaluation shows that IDK and WD are effective distributional measures for time series; and IDK-based detectors have better detection accuracy than existing sliding-window-based detectors, and they run faster with linear time complexity.},

To this aim, we study asymptotic null distribution of the functional Lawley–Hotelling trace (FLH) test statistic and approximate it by a Welch–Satterthwaite type χ 2-approximation. We describe two approaches to estimating the parameters in the χ 2-approximation ratio-consistently. The resulting FLH test has the correct asymptotic level, is root-n consistent in detecting local alternatives, and is computationally efficient. The numerical performance is examined via some simulation studies and application to three real data examples. The proposed FLH test is comparable with four existing tests based on permutation in terms of size control and power. The major advantage is that it is much faster to compute.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2212.06108},
	abstract = {For multivariate data with noise variables, tandem clustering is a well-known technique that aims to improve cluster identification by first reducing the dimension. However, the usual approach using principal component analysis (PCA) has been criticized for focusing only on inertia so that the first components do not necessarily retain the structure of interest for clustering. To overcome this drawback, a new tandem clustering approach based on invariant coordinate selection (ICS) is proposed. By jointly diagonalizing two scatter matrices, ICS is designed to find structure in the data while returning affine invariant components. Some theoretical results have already been derived and guarantee that under some elliptical mixture models, the group structure can be highlighted on a subset of the first and/or last components. Nevertheless, ICS has received little attention in a clustering context. Two challenges are the choice of the pair of scatter matrices and the selection of the components to retain. For clustering purposes, it is demonstrated that the best scatter pairs consist of one scatter matrix that captures the within-cluster structure and another that captures the global structure. For the former, local shape or pairwise scatters are of great interest, as is the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator based on a carefully selected subset size that is smaller than usual. The performance of ICS as a dimension reduction method is evaluated in terms of preserving the cluster structure present in data. In an extensive simulation study and in empirical applications with benchmark data sets, different combinations of scatter matrices as well as component selection criteria are compared in situations with and without outliers. Overall, the new approach of tandem clustering with ICS shows promising results and clearly outperforms the approach with PCA.},

We focus on one-step M-scatter matrices and propose a new implementation of ICS based on a pivoted QR factorization of the centered data set. This factorization avoids the direct computation of the scatter matrices and their inverse and brings numerical stability to the algorithm. Furthermore, the row and column pivoting leads to a rank revealing procedure that allows computation of ICS when the scatter matrices are not full rank.

	abstract = {With the increased occurrence of hot spells in recent years, there is growing interest in quantifying the recurrence of extreme temperature events. However, pronounced temperature anomalies occur all year round, and a reliable classification in terms of the time of occurrence in the year is needed. In this study, we present a novel approach to classifying daily air temperatures that take into account the seasonal cycle and climate change. We model the distribution of the daily Swiss temperatures using the skewed generalized error distribution with four time-varying parameters, thereby accounting for non-Gaussianity in daily air temperature, while the climatic trend is modeled linearly with smoothed northern hemisphere temperature as an explanatory variable. The daily observations are then transformed into a standard normal distribution. The resultant standardized temperature anomalies are comparable within a year and between years and are used for quantile-based empirical classification. The approach is suitable to classify historical and current extreme temperatures with respect to the temperature range expected at the time of the event. For example, a heat wave occurring at the end of June is classified as less likely to occur than a heat wave of similar intensity occurring in mid-July, as is shown for the two 7-day heat waves that struck Switzerland in the summer of 2019. Furthermore, climate change has increased the probability of hot events and decreased the probability of cold events in recent years. The presented approach thus allows a fair classification of extreme temperatures within a year and between years and offers new possibilities to analyze daily air temperature.},

The MRCT estimator employs a subset-based approach that prioritizes subsets exhibiting greater centrality based on the generalization of the Mahalanobis distance, resulting in a fast-MCD type algorithm. Notably, the MRCT estimator handles high-dimensional data sets without the need for preprocessing or dimension reduction techniques, due to the internal smoothening whose amount is determined by the regularization parameter \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textgreater} 0\$. The selection of the regularization parameter \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ is automated. The proposed method adapts seamlessly to sparsely observed data by working directly with the finite matrix of basis coefficients. An extensive simulation study demonstrates the efficacy of the MRCT estimator in terms of robust covariance estimation and automated outlier detection, emphasizing the balance between noise exclusion and signal preservation achieved through appropriate selection of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$. The method converges fast in practice and performs favorably when compared to other functional outlier detection methods.},

(J R Stat Soc Ser B (Stat Methodol) 71(3):549–592, 2009) and based on the simultaneous diagonalization of two scatter matrices. A model-based approach of ICS, called invariant coordinate analysis, has already been adapted for compositional data in Muehlmann et al. (Independent component analysis for compositional data. In Daouia, A, Ruiz-Gazen A (eds) Advances in Contemporary Statistics and Econometrics: Festschrift in Honor of Christine Thomas-Agnan. Springer, New York, pp. 525–545, 2021). In a model-free context, ICS is also helpful at identifying outliers Nordhausen and Ruiz-Gazen (J Multivar Anal 188:104844, 2022). We propose to develop a version of ICS for outlier detection in compositional data. This version is first introduced in coordinate space for a specific choice of isometric log-ratio coordinate system associated to a contrast matrix and follows the outlier detection procedure proposed by Archimbaud et al. (Comput Stat Data Anal 128:184–199, 2018a). We then show that the procedure is independent of the choice of contrast matrix and can be defined directly in the simplex. To do so, we establish some properties of the set of matrices satisfying the zero-sum property and introduce a simplex definition of the Mahalanobis distance and the one-step M-estimators class of scatter matrices. We also need to define the family of elliptical distributions in the simplex. We then show how to interpret the results directly in the simplex using two artificial datasets and a real dataset of market shares in the automobile industry.},

	abstract = {Functional data clustering is to identify heterogeneous morphological patterns in the continuous functions underlying the discrete measurements/observations. Application of functional data clustering has appeared in many publications across various fields of sciences, including but not limited to biology, (bio)chemistry, engineering, environmental science, medical science, psychology, social science, and so on. The phenomenal growth of the application of functional data clustering indicates the urgent need for a systematic approach to develop efficient clustering methods and scalable algorithmic implementations. On the other hand, there is abundant literature on the cluster analysis of time series, trajectory data, spatio-temporal data, and so on, which are all related to functional data. Therefore, an overarching structure of existing functional data clustering methods will enable the cross-pollination of ideas across various research fields. We here conduct a comprehensive review of original clustering methods for functional data. We propose a systematic taxonomy that explores the connections and differences among the existing functional data clustering methods and relates them to the conventional multivariate clustering methods. The structure of the taxonomy is built on three main attributes of a functional data clustering method and therefore is more reliable than existing categorizations. The review aims to bridge the gap between the functional data analysis community and the clustering community and to generate new principles for functional data clustering.},

	abstract = {Distributional data have recently become increasingly important for understanding processes in the geosciences, thanks to the establishment of cost-efﬁcient analytical instruments capable of measuring properties over large numbers of particles, grains or crystals in a sample. Functional data analysis allows the direct application of multivariate methods, such as principal component analysis, to such distributions. However, these are often observed in the form of samples, and thus incur a sampling error. This additional sampling error changes the properties of the multivariate variance and thus the number of relevant principal components and their direction. The result of the principal component analysis becomes an artifact of the sampling error and can negatively affect the subsequent data analysis. This work presents a way of estimating this sampling error and how to confront it in the context of principal component analysis, where the principal components are obtained as a linear combination of elements of a newly constructed orthogonal spline basis. The effect of the sampling error and the effectiveness of the correction is demonstrated with a series of simulations. It is shown how the interpretability and reproducibility of the principal components improve and become independent of the selection of the basis. The proposed method is then applied on a dataset of grain size distributions in a geometallurgical dataset from Thaba mine in the Bushveld complex.},

	abstract = {This book describes the iterative steps that were successfully undertaken to develop adaptation measures to climate change in two Vietnamese provinces. The methodology used to develop the scientific basis and the societal agreement of the need to adapt to climate change is applicable also to other regions in Vietnam, Asia and worldwide.

The uncertainties of climate change models make it difficult to justify investments to finance protection from uncertain impacts. Setting out with the projected climate change impacts in Vietnam, which is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, the book describes a methodological approach to assess and evaluate local vulnerabilities of natural resources to climate change and socio-economic impacts, engaging local stakeholders in the development of locally acceptable and economically feasible adaptation measures. The methodological approach to understand the vulnerabilities and to develop climate change adaptation measures was scenario workshops that supported the communication between scientists and stakeholders.

The development of climate change adaptation strategies is nearly state-of-the-art in many countries, but often there is still a large step towards implementing climate change adaptation measures on the local level. The challenge in the development of adaptation measures lies in their acceptability by local stakeholders and decision makers. Climate change adaptation measures also usually demand investments. To understand potential future risks the communication methodology was to first get a good understanding of the natural resources (mainly surface and groundwater) and their potential vulnerabilities (current and future). This was followed by developing a common understanding of current risk patterns, as well as underlying vulnerabilities and hazards. Socio-economic developments have an equally strong, and in the short term mostly even stronger, impact on the living environment and natural resources as long-term climate change impacts. The scenario workshops developed a holistic approach on current and potential future risk patterns, with a special focus on surface and groundwater quantities and qualities, natural hazards and sea level rise. Land-use planning was identified as playing a decisive role in minimizing current and future risks. Finally, first adaptation measures for two Vietnamese provinces were developed and shall be implemented over the next years. The methodology that led to these adaptation measures shall be applied in other Vietnamese provinces.},

To allow continued data processing into the future, and to take advantage of several important innovations that could improve system performance, a decision was made to produce MERRA-2, an updated retrospective analysis of the full modern satellite era. One of the many advances in MERRA-2 is a constraint on the global dry mass balance; this allows the global changes in water by the analysis increment to be near zero, thereby minimizing abrupt global interannual variations due to changes in the observing system. In addition, MERRA-2 includes the assimilation of interactive aerosols into the system, a feature of the Earth system absent from previous reanalyses. Also, in an effort to improve land surface hydrology, observations-corrected precipitation forcing is used instead of model-generated precipitation. Overall, MERRA-2 takes advantage of numerous updates to the global modeling and data assimilation system. In this document, we summarize an initial evaluation of the climate in MERRA-2, from the surface to the stratosphere and from the tropics to the poles. Strengths and weaknesses of the MERRA-2 climate are accordingly emphasized.},

	url = {https://ideas.repec.org//p/avg/wpaper/en9476.html},
	abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine farm household-level impacts of weather extreme events on Vietnamese rice technical efficiency. Vietnam is considered among the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and the Vietnamese economy is highly dependent on rice production that is strongly affected by climate change. A stochastic frontier analysis is applied with census panel data and weather data from 2010 to 2014 to estimate these impacts while controlling for both adaptation strategy and household characteristics. Also, this study combines these estimated marginal effects with future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5) to project the potential impact of hot temperatures in 2050 on rice technical efficiency. We find that weather shocks measured by the occurrence of floods, typhoons and droughts negatively affect technical efficiency. Also, additional days with a temperature above 31°C dampen technical efficiency and the negative effect is increasing with temperature. For instance, a one day increase in the bin [33°C-34°C] ([35°C and more[) lessen technical efficiency between 6.84 (2.82) and 8.05 (3.42) percentage points during the dry (wet) season.},

	abstract = {La détection d’observations atypiques de manière non-supervisée est un enjeu crucial dans la pratique de la statistique. Dans le domaine de la détection de défauts industriels, cette tâche est d’une importance capitale pour assurer une production de haute qualité. Avec l’accroissement exponentiel du nombre de mesures effectuées sur les composants électroniques, la problématique de la grande dimension se pose lors de la recherche d’anomalies. Pour relever ce challenge, l’entreprise ippon innovation, spécialiste en statistique industrielle et détection d’anomalies, s’est associée au laboratoire de recherche TSE-R en finançant ce travail de thèse. Le premier chapitre commence par présenter le contexte du contrôle de qualité et les différentes procédures déjà mises en place, principalement dans les entreprises de semi-conducteurs pour l’automobile. Comme ces pratiques ne répondent pas aux nouvelles attentes requises par le traitement de données en grande dimension, d’autres solutions doivent être envisagées. La suite du chapitre résume l’ensemble des méthodes multivariées et non supervisées de détection d’observations atypiques existantes, en insistant tout particulièrement sur celles qui gèrent des données en grande dimension. Le Chapitre 2 montre théoriquement que la très connue distance de Mahalanobis n’est pas adaptée à la détection d’anomalies si celles-ci sont contenues dans un sous-espace de petite dimension alors que le nombre de variables est grand.Dans ce contexte, la méthode Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS) est alors introduite comme une alternative intéressante à la mise en évidence de la structure des données atypiques. Une méthodologie pour sélectionner seulement les composantes d’intérêt est proposée et ses performances sont comparées aux standards habituels sur des simulations ainsi que sur des exemples réels industriels. Cette nouvelle procédure a été mise en oeuvre dans un package R, ICSOutlier, présenté dans le Chapitre 3 ainsi que dans une application R shiny (package ICSShiny) qui rend son utilisation plus simple et plus attractive.Une des conséquences directes de l’augmentation du nombre de dimensions est la singularité des estimateurs de dispersion multivariés, dès que certaines variables sont colinéaires ou que leur nombre excède le nombre d’individus. Or, la définition d’ICS par Tyler et al. (2009) se base sur des estimateurs de dispersion définis positifs. Le Chapitre 4 envisage différentes pistes pour adapter le critère d’ICS et investigue de manière théorique les propriétés de chacune des propositions présentées. La question de l’affine invariance de la méthode est en particulier étudiée. Enfin le dernier chapitre, se consacre à l’algorithme développé pour l’entreprise. Bien que cet algorithme soit confidentiel, le chapitre donne les idées générales et précise les challenges relevés, notamment numériques.},

A regularization method is introduced through a careful characterization of the function space in which a covariance function resides. It is shown that the procedure enjoys desirable theoretical and numerical properties. In particular, even though the covariance function is bivariate, the rates of convergence attained by the regularization method are very similar to those typically achieved for estimating univariate functions. Our results generalize and improve some of the known results in the literature both for estimating the covariance function and for estimating the functional principal components. The procedure is easy to implement and its numerical performance is investigated using both simulated and real data. In particular our method is illustrated in an analysis of a longitudinal CD4 count data from an HIV study.},

	abstract = {Mahalanobis distance is a classical tool in multivariate analysis. We suggest here an extension of this concept to the case of functional data. More precisely, the proposed definition concerns those statistical problems where the sample data are real functions defined on a compact interval of the real line. The obvious difficulty for such a functional extension is the non-invertibility of the covariance operator in infinite-dimensional cases. Unlike other recent proposals, our definition is suggested and motivated in terms of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) associated with the stochastic process that generates the data. The proposed distance is a true metric; it depends on a unique real smoothing parameter which is fully motivated in RKHS terms. Moreover, it shares some properties of its finite dimensional counterpart: it is invariant under isometries, it can be consistently estimated from the data and its sampling distribution is known under Gaussian models. An empirical study for two statistical applications, outliers detection and binary classification, is included. The results are quite competitive when compared to other recent proposals in the literature.},

	isbn = {978-1-315-37054-5},
	abstract = {In a time when increasingly larger and complex data collections are being produced, it is clear that new and adaptive forms of data representation and analysis have to be conceived and implemented. Distributional data, i.e., data where a distribution rather than a single value is recorded for each descriptor, on each unit, come into this framework. Distributional data may result from the aggregation of large amounts of open/collected/generated data, or it may be directly available in a structured or unstructured form, describing the variability of some features. This book provides models and methods for the representation, analysis, interpretation, and organization of distributional data, taking into account its specific nature, and not relying on a reduction to single values, to be conform to classical paradigms.Conceived as an edited book, gathering contributions from multiple authors, the book presents alternative representations and analysis’ methods for distributional data of different types, and in particular,-Uni- and bi-variate descriptive statistics for distributional data-Clustering and classification methodologies-Methods for the representation in low-dimensional spaces-Regression models and forecasting approaches for distribution-valued variables
Furthermore, the different chapters -Feature applications to show how the proposed methods work in practice, and how results are to be interpreted, -Often provide information about available software.
The methodologies presented in this book constitute cutting-edge developments for stakeholders from all domains who produce and analyse large amounts of complex data, to be analysed in the form of distributions. The book is hence of interest for companies operating not only in the area of data analytics, but also on logistics, energy and finance. It also concerns national statistical institutes and other institutions at European and international level, where microdata is aggregated to preserve confidentiality and allow for analysis at the appropriate regional level. Academics will find in the analysis of distributional data a challenging up-to-date field of research.},
